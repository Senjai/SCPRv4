&lt;p&gt;Education writer and L.A. public school parent Liz Dwyer has written about the growing trend of parental school fundraising in a recent issue of GOOD magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With diminishing funding for public schools, parents are being asked to make up the difference - or at least some of the difference. That means they have to spend more of their time fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guest:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz Dwyer&lt;/b&gt; is the education editor for GOOD Magazine and she also has two children in L.A.'s public schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://www.scpr.org/programs/madeleine-brand/2012/03/20/25686/parenting-on-the-edge-parents-fundraising-face-new</guid></item><item><title>NPR's Quil Lawrence: Karzai wants quicker withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan</title><link>http://www.scpr.org/programs/madeleine-brand/2012/03/20/25685/nprs-quil-lawrence-reports-from-afghanistan</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;Quil Lawrence, NPR's correspondent in Kabul, talks with Madeleine about the latest from Afghanistan. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has stated he wants a quicker withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country in the wake of recent incidents involving the US military; The inadvertent burning of Qorans sparked an outrage last month, and an American soldier is suspected of killing 16 Afghan civilians in Kandahar province on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Afghan farmer lost his mother, wife, sister-in-law, brother, nephew, his four daughters and two of his sons in last week's shooting. His 4-year-old son is the only other individual remaining from his family.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials from the California State University system have announced plans to freeze student enrollment next spring. And If a proposed tax initiative on the upcoming November election doesn't pass, student enrollment numbers for fall 2013 could be slashed by 25,000. A university spokesman said there was no other choice, since raising tuition for the seventh year in a row was unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan will be presented to the CSU Board of Trustees today, but Chancellor Charles Reed has the authority to limit student enrollment without trustee approval. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cal State Board is also voting on 10 percent salary increases for two incoming college presidents at the CSU Fullerton and East Bay campuses. Their salaries would be more than $300,000 each. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top U.S. Commander in Afghanistan, Marine General John Allen, testified before the House Armed Services Committee Tuesday morning. He stated that the U.S. is on track to withdraw combat forces from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Allen spoke directly to recent events that have had a negative impact on the effort.  He noted the burning of Qurans by coalition troops and the murder of 16 civilians, allegedly committed by a U.S. serviceman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://a.scpr.org/i/bbc1c38478b96ce5bdc1b5eba9c37b2e/35351-wide.jpg" width="554" height="414" alt="" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Volunteers helping children with new TOMS shoes. Some critics believe the company's business plan is flawed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a good chance you've heard of TOMS, the Santa Monica company that makes slip-on shoes and is firmly established in fashion-conscious L.A. The company has become as famous for its laid-back style as its creative marketing â€“ the company promises that for every pair of shoes purchased, it will donate another pair to a child in need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now other companies are trying out similar business models. For example, if you buy a pair eyeglasses from Warby Parker, it gives a pair away. And a start-up called Two Degrees gives a meal to a malnourished child for every nutrition bar it sells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But none has been nearly as successful with the so-called "Buy One, Give One" model as TOMS. The for-profit company has sold more than two million pairs of shoes and is at least a $100 million enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporter Amy Costello has been looking into TOMS for her &lt;a href= "http://www.tinyspark.org/podcasts/toms-shoes/"&gt;podcast Tiny Spark&lt;/a&gt;, which reports on charitable organizations and the business of doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most obvious reason for TOMS' success comes down to the founder Blake Mycoskie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think part of Blake's success with TOMS Shoes has to do with his media appeal," said Costello. "He's 35, curly haired, very handsome and incredibly charismatic. And, as you know, for better or worse, these things do help when you're trying to get media attention."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Costello reports, Mycoskie has used these features for less philanthropic ends. In 2002, he competed on the television show "The Amazing Race," and prior to that he was Mr. Tennessee and on the FOX show "America's Sexiest Bachelor." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In my story, I describe a guy who has really always been chasing the media spotlight," said Costello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And despite all the praise for his TOMS business, not everyone is convinced by the company's positive impact in developing countries. Laura Freschi from NYU critiques the production of TOMS, whose factories are located in China, Argentina and Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm concerned that TOMS sort of creates the impression that there are no shoes to be purchased in some of these communities, when in fact there are vibrant local economies," Freschi said. "And in many of these places where they're giving shoes, people are producing shoes ... in some cases the 'buy one, give one' model practiced this way could be harmful to those local producers and sellers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other socially-conscious entrepreneurs have taken note of the criticism. Patrick Woodyard, founder of shoe company Nisolo, considered the TOMS model but ultimately decided against it. "It's not a sustainable model," he said. "It's not addressing the root of the problem, which is marginalization or poverty ... the purpose of what we try to do with Nisolo is to take it a few steps further to generate a micro-economy, to create jobs."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woodyard's decision was partly informed by his experience on a "shoe drop" in Peru, one of the ways TOMS delivers its shoes. Although Woodyard went with another organization, the experience was not what he expected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Just about every child who came in had shoes ... and it wasn't the beautiful exchange that's often times advertised by TOMS shoes ... there's not really room for growth on behalf of the person being helped, or self-empowerment for that person and for long-term change in their life," Woodyard recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Costello said Woodyard's experience can even be seen in TOMS own promotional material. "If you go to TOMS' own website, you will find image after image of children who clearly already have their own shoes, being fitted with new TOMS shoes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counting the number of TOMS shoes given away also raises questions about the partners it uses to distribute shoes. It relies on the "Giving Partners," a group of non-profit organizations with many Evangelical Christian groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And despite U.S. government restrictions on evangelizing while giving out aid, Costello found that in some cases, the shoe company blatantly violated such rules. For instance, she found photos of missionaries in Rwanda putting TOMS shoes on kids while wearing t-shirts that said "Make Jesus Famous."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costello also discovered a blog entry by an American evangelical visiting India who wrote about how her colleague stood before a group of children at the TOMS shoe distribution and said, "These shoes are not from us, they are from people around the world who want to give them to you, they are a blessing from the Lord." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California schools may get some relief this fall. There are two competing ballot initiatives in the upcoming November election that would raise taxes and increase money towards K-12 education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One plan, pushed by Gov. Jerry Brown and the California Federation of Teachers, would temporarily increase the state's sales tax and raise taxes on high-income earners. Another plan â€” headed by Pasadena attorney Molly Munger, an independently wealthy education advocate on a mission to improve public schools â€” would raise about $10 billion a year by raising personal income tax rates for almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political observers say the dueling initiatives could confuse voters at the polls. But as KQED's John Myers reports, Munger is refusing to back down.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">By John Myers, The California Report</dc:creator><guid>http://www.scpr.org/programs/madeleine-brand/2012/03/20/25679/education-activist-finances-school-tax-measure</guid></item><item><title>Ann Powers' top picks from SXSW festival</title><link>http://www.scpr.org/programs/madeleine-brand/2012/03/20/25673/ann-powers-reports-from-sxsw</link><description>

&lt;p&gt;Music critic Ann Powers has just returned from South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. She shares a few of her favorite new musicians and noteworthy albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a new British female rapper making waves. She goes by Lady LeShurr and her music is a combination of house, hip hop and pop. She says her top influence is Lil' Wayne. At the festival, she dazzled the audience with an improvisation with the band, according to Powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listen:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lady Leshurr - &lt;a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6q0mJkz01zuvkwrFE77D7r"&gt;"LEGO"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeus is a Canadian rock band whose music is reminiscent of the 1970s. Their second album, "Busting Visions," comes out in late March. With the exception of their drummer Rob Drake, all of the band members, Mike O'Brien, Carlin Nicholson and Neil Quin, both sing and play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stasia Irons and Catherin Harris-White met at the University of Washington and formed THEESatisfaction. They perform funkadelic music that has a taste of black jazz and soul, and they also rap. Powers first saw them at SXSW two years ago, and says that they've only gotten a lot better over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the Supreme Court is hearing a case that may have far reaching influence on juveniles and how they are punished. The court will hear arguments in the cases of Evan Miller and Kuntrell Jackson, who were both sentenced to life in prison for separate murders when they were 14-years-old. The issue in both cases is whether a life sentence imposed on someone so young constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled that executing juveniles is unconstitutional. Before that ruling, the United States and Somalia were the only two countries permitting the execution of teenagers. The court held that executing juveniles goes against "the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Psychological Association filed a brief with the court regarding Miller and Jackson's cases stating that "juveniles are still developing their character and identity" and that there is no reliable way to confirm that a juvenile will not change or reform with time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles County's public hospital system is one of the most beleaguered in the the nation. Many would-be reformers have come and gone over the years, but the latest one just may have the magic touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cops face a lot of stress. In San Bernardino, there's a policeman who's found a particularly creative way of dealing with the pressures of his profession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Bernardino's Sgt. Dwight Waldo has made it his mission to study &lt;a href="http://www.scpr.org/programs/offramp/2012/03/16/25645/south-central-graffiti-tour"&gt;the habits of graffiti taggers&lt;/a&gt; and to clean up the city's walls. He has been working on defeating graffiti for most of his 28 year career. He even wrote a book on the subject and is teaching other police officers how to effectively combat graffiti. Now, the city walls have never been cleaner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waldo also found that taggers become expert at scaling large buildings and finding their way onto private property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't take them long before they figure out that they can climb up a building and vandalize it or they can climb in a window and steal things. And we find that a lot of our burglars start as taggers because that's almost like their schooling for how to become a burglar," he said. Waldo's efforts, combined with a full-time cleanup crew, are cutting down on crime while beautifying the city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years ago Waldo took up music and decided to play his violin in public. It's his own way of expressing himself artistically. He's known to many as "the violin man" when not in uniform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When I play, it's like a totally opposite thing. I don't have to be concerned about what's going on around me that much, what's happening, I can just simply focus on what I can create, what I can make happen," he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waldo moves through the streets, playing his violin. Not unlike the taggers he hunts, he's always on the lookout for a new place to play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Life is about balance and you can't have a time when you're intense all the time. It doesn't make you good at what you do on duty, it doesn't make you good at what you do off duty."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waldo suspects he'll retire soon. He plans to continue to find unusual places to play his violin. &lt;/p&gt;
