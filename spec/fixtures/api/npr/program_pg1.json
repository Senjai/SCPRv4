(You can <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/05/01/180375856/20-years-ago-biz-markie-got-the-last-laugh\" target=\"_blank\">trace our current understanding of the copyright laws around sampling </a>to a 1991 suit by Gilbert O'Sullivan against Biz Markie for the use of O'Sullivan's \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" in Biz's song \"Alone Again.\")</p>   <p>If a deal can't be reached, or the sound of the original recording isn't quite right, the musician can re-record an element of the song she loves, say a little snippet of melody or a particular drum pattern. This is called <strong>interpolation</strong>. The re-created element can be a nearly exact replica or just vaguely similar. Sometimes, an interpolation can be so close that it's hard to tell if it's any different at all — think of Vanilla Ice's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s0hEi8zhmg\" target=\"_blank\">famous denial</a> that \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE\" target=\"_blank\">Ice Ice Baby</a>\" was sampled directly from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/90283085/queen\" target=\"_blank\">Queen</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15289962/david-bowie\" target=\"_blank\">David Bowie</a>'s \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUW_8cWG7YA\" target=\"_blank\">Under Pressure</a>.\" If it's really a new performance, permission is not needed, but the writer of the original song gets credit and, if there are royalties, a share of the money. (Think of cover songs as extended interpolations.)</p>   <p>Then there's the shady, mysterious land that occupies the area between what we'll call \"inspiration\" and \"coincidence.\" Here's where things get contentious. Pop music history is full of tributes, riffs and echoes that make us turn to the radio and go: \"Haven't I heard this song before?\" Sometimes, it turns out, we have.</p></div><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2013 NPR.

They build schools, provide medicine or give people cows.</p>   <p>When we were in Kenya recently, we visited a village where people had been given cows by a group called Heifer International. And, we can report, these were very impressive cows. They looked strong and healthy.</p>   <p>And, like lots of charities, Heifer also spends money to provide training. Working with another group called Send a Cow, Heifer teaches people to make sure their cows get the right nutrition and to keep detailed logs tracking milk production. People visited the village to make sure everything was going well. And all this really helped. One woman told us her cow produces 15 times as much milk as local cows — and she sells most of the milk.</p>   <p>That's a traditional charity. GiveDirectly, on the other hand, takes money from donors and just gives it to poor people. (For more on how GiveDirectly works, see our story from this morning.) This is something of a challenge to other charities. Paul Niehaus, one of the group's founders, is pretty blunt about it.</p>   <p>\"We would like to see organizations make the case that they can do more good for the poor with a dollar than the poor can do for themselves,\" he says. \"And I think some may be able to make a convincing case. But if you go to the websites, today I don't think you're going to be seeing that argument being made. Nobody even bothers.\"</p>   <p>Neihaus says charities should be clear about how much they're spending and how much it's helping. And to figure this out, he says, charities should do actual experiments. In GiveDirectly's case, independent researchers are conducting a randomized, controlled trial. Basically, there are two groups of villagers. One group gets money, the other doesn't. The researchers do a detailed survey to compare the two groups and see what difference getting money makes. The results from the study are due out later this year. And they'll be made public.</p>   <p>If you were trying to compare giving cows and training with giving cash, you could take the same approach. Give people in one village cows and training; in the next village over, take the money you would have spent on cows and training and just give it to people.</p>   <p>Not surprisingly, Niehaus loved this idea. We called up Heifer International to see what it thought, and we talked to Elizabeth Bintliff, vice president of Heifer's Africa programs.</p>   <p>\"As an African woman, that sounds to me like a terrible idea,\" she said. \"It sounds like an experiment, and we're not about experiments. These are lives of real people.\" The world is \"just not that linear,\" she said. \"It's not an equation.

He explains:</p>   <blockquote class=\"edTag\"><div>   <p>\"Months after the August 1963 March on Washington, King himself sued to prevent the unauthorized sale of his speech, purportedly in an effort to control proceeds and use them to support the civil-rights movement. In 1999, the King family sued CBS after the network produced a video documentary that 'used, without authorization, portions of ... King's 'I Have a Dream' speech.' A divided Appellate Court, in reversing a lower court ruling, held that the speech was not a \"general publication,\" despite its huge audience and subsequent historic importance. The speech instead qualified as a \"limited publication,\" the court said, because \"distribution to the news media, as opposed to the general public, for the purpose of enabling the reporting of a contemporary newsworthy event, is only a limited publication.</p>   <p>\"The ruling was narrow, and CBS and the King estate settled the case before the lower court could reconsider, leaving the copyright of the speech in a somewhat confusing legal situation. A CBS press release dated July 12, 2000, discusses the agreement that allowed the network to 'retain the right to use its footage of the speeches' from the march and license it to others in exchange for an undisclosed contribution to the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Nonviolent Social Change.</p>   <p>\"In 2009, EMI Publishing cut a deal with the King estate to help ensure that the speech was 'accorded the same protection and same right for compensation as other copyrights.' EMI was sold in 2011 to a consortium headed by Sony. The King Center did not respond to requests for comment.\"</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p>The bottom line is that online presence of the speech is likely to be problematic until 2038, when King's copyright expires. U.S. law states that an author keeps a copyright for life plus 70 years.</p>   <p>All of that said, an activist organization called Fight for the Future <a href=\"http://www.fightforthefuture.org/mlk\">has taken it upon itself to provide ready access to the speech</a>. On Internet Freedom Day, the organization uploaded video of the entire 17-minute speech, which, at the moment, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIshI_qxxew#t=1068\">is still available on YouTube</a>.</p>   <p>Volz, by the way, will be on tonight's edition of <em>All Things Considered</em> to talk about his reporting. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/stations/\">Click here</a> for a NPR member station near you.
