# abstract (noun) - a summary of a text, scientific article, document, 
# speech, etc.
#
# Abstract is basically a summary of an article.
# It was created to be used with the Edition model, and to be
# presented from within the mobile application, but there is
# no reason that it couldn't also be used on the website
# if there was a place for it.
#
# "How is this different from a ContentShell?". 
# I'm glad you asked.
#
# A ContentShell is really just a reference, or pointer, to a 
# remote source. It isn't content, although it does show up in 
# the normal rotation of Content (among news stories and blog 
# posts). Rather, it is an anchor to another website, and is 
# intended to be clicked 100% of the time. A ContentShell
# is a teaser to someone else's work.
#
# An Abstract is similar, no doubt. However, it has some key 
# differences. It is meant to summarize an article. It is not
# expected to produce clickthroughs - the idea is that someone
# could read the summary of an Abstract, or listen to its audio,
# and feel adequately informed - only those who are really 
# interested in the details will click through to the remote 
# article. An Abstract is substantive and could have its own
# landing page on our website.
# 
# 
# "How is this different, then, from a NewsStory?"
# Jeez, you ask a lot of questions.
#
# A NewsStory is *more* substantial than an Abstract. It has 
# several paragraphs of body copy, and is meant to be read fully.
# There can be Abstracts for our NewsStories.
#
# So, think of an Abstract as being somewhere between ContentShell
# and NewsStory. Sort of.
#
#
# "But couldn't we just-"
# No. We're done here.
