# An article is an abstract object, which is not persisted,
# but rather meant to be built manually from the attributes
# of another object.
#
# An Article should be the publc API for the parts of our
# presentational layer which mix different types of content.
# So in the areas where we're displaying blog entries, news
# stories, events, etc. all together, we shouldn't have to
# worry about whether one of the classes has defined an
# "audio" instance method, for example. We just coerce
# everything into an Article, and then *know* that it will
# work. This eliminates a lot of the "fakery" going on in
# our classes - stuff like `def teaser; self.body; end`.
#
# This also makes it super-easy to mix any content into the 
# normal flow of things. If one day we decided that Bios
# should show up in the normal rotation on the homepage 
# (this is a contrived example to illustrate the point),
# it would be a simple matter of defining a `to_article` 
# instance method on the Bio class. How a Bio gets coerced
# into an Article is up to the developer.
#
# An Article object doesn't do anything fancy. It just acts
# exactly the way we need it to.
#
# This should pretty much match up with what our client API
# response is, but it doesn't necessarily have to.
