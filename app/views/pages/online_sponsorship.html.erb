<h2>The perfect opportunity for your business...</h2>

<p>There are a lot of choices when it comes to marketing your business. You may have come here to look at opportunities on-air; a great way to reach 600,000* people in the LA Metro a week. But SCPR coverage doesn't end in the car radio. With live-stream, podcasts and online banners, the KPCC Web site is our award-winning news enhanced for listeners who have come to expect something more than just fleeting headlines. </p>

<p>Whether our nearly 300,000** web viewers a month are downloading podcasts, listening to the live-stream, reading our host's blogs or signing up for an e-newsletter, they will see not only your company's support of KPCC but associate your business with the news they value most. </p>

<p>And speaking of valueâ€¦it's a two way street. These are some of our affordable offerings for the Web site, audio elements and our e-newsletters.</p>
