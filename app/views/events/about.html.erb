  <h2>About The Crawford Family Forum</h2>
  <p>The Crawford Family Forum is a welcoming, non-partisan, knowledge-building space where Southern Californians of all backgrounds can engage in the face-to-face exchange of knowledge and ideas that is becoming increasingly rare in the digital era.  Nothing can replace real-life interactionâ€”having an opportunity to not just hear, but see others and have direct dialogue goes a long way toward helping build bridges among communities while strengthening, deepening and expanding our public service.  </p>
